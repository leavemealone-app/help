## How can I delete my account?

**WARNING:** This is permanent and cannot be undone!
{% endhint %}

You can deactivate your account [here](https://leavemealone.app/app/danger/deactivate). This will delete all of your data, revoke your API keys, and sign you out.

You will still be able to create an account again to clean your inbox in the future.

### What data is erased when I delete my account?
