## How can I downgrade my plan?

If you want to downgrade your plan please contact us and we can switch you to a cheaper plan.

## How can I cancel my plan?

You can cancel your plan at any time from the [billing page](https://leavemealone.app/app/profile/billing). You will still be able to use Leave Me Alone and will receive any Rollups until the end of your billing period.

**After then your subscription will be canceled, which means:**

* All of your Rollups will be disabled.
* Inbox Shield will stop blocking your mail
* Your unlimited unsubscribes will be stopped
