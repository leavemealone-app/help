## Step 1: Find your IMAP details

To connect your account to Leave Me Alone you will need the host and port for your mail provider's IMAP server.

You can usually find this by searching Google for "**&lt;your email account&gt; IMAP settings**".

## Step 2: Connect your account

1. Enter your email address and wait for us to select your account type \(or you can click the dropdown on the right of the field to change the account type\)
2. Enter your password \(this is usually the password you use to sign in\)
3. Enter the IMAP host and port you found in [Step 1](connecting-other-imap.md#step-1-find-your-imap-details)
4. Click **Connect account**
