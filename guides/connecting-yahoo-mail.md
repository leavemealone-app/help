All done!

You can now connect your Yahoo Mail to [Leave Me Alone](https://leavemealone.app/) using your email address and the App Password you just generated.

## Troubleshooting

### App Passwords unavailable

When you try to create an **app password** you might see this pop-up:

This means that unfortunately Yahoo has disabled the **app password** functionality for your account. Due to abuse of their system Yahoo will now only allow "trusted" accounts to use this functionality. In order to become a trusted account and re-enable app passwords you have to contact their support by email.
