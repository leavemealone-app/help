## Troubleshooting

### The setting that you are looking for is not available for your account.

You must [enable 2-step verification](connecting-gmail.md#step-2-turn-on-2-step-verification) for this setting to be available for your Google account.

### The password is incorrect for this account

Make sure that you're using the [app password generated in step 3](connecting-gmail.md#step-3-create-an-app-password) above.

​​If you still can’t connect your account, try the following:  
  
1. On your device’s browser, go to [https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha).  
2. Enter your username and password, then enter the letters on the screen.  
3. Go back to Leave Me Alone and try connecting again.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you have completed the Display Unlock Captcha you have 10 minutes to connect your account.
{% endhint %}
