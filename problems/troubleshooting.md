# Troubleshooting

## I'm not seeing any emails in Leave Me Alone

Sometimes the scan can get stuck. You can restart it by visiting your [profile settings here](https://leavemealone.app/app/profile), scrolling to the bottom, and clicking the button "Clear Local Emails". Now when you go back to the mail list page it should restart the scan and hopefully it work this time!
