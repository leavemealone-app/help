# FAQ

## How can you tell which emails are subscriptions?

We never read the content of any of your emails but we do have access to some metadata - information about an email which you don't usually see.

This metadata tells us if the email has an unsubscribe link or instructions on how to unsubscribe, if it does then we show it to you in Leave Me Alone for you to unsubscribe from. 

## I accidentally unsubscribed from something, how can I re-subscribe?

Sorry, we can't subscribe you to a mailing list you have unsubscribed from. You'd need to visit the website for that mailing list and subscribe again manually.

## How can I delete my account?

{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING:** This is permanent and cannot be undone!
{% endhint %}

You can deactivate your account [here](https://leavemealone.app/app/danger/deactivate). This will delete all of your data, revoke your API keys, and sign you out.

You will still be able to create an account again to clean your inbox in the future.
