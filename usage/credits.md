# What are credits?

Each credit you purchase or earn in Leave Me Alone lets you [unsubscribe ](../start-here/how-to-unsubscribe-from-an-email.md)from **one email** in the mail list.

### Top-up Credits

If you just need to unsubscribe from emails then you can purchase Top-up Credits. These come in packages of 50, 100, 200, and 300, so that you can choose the correct number of unsubscribes for you mailbox.

You can see more information about our credit pricing on our [price page](https://leavemealone.app/pricing).

### Monthly Credits

When you purchase a Leave Me Alone Plan you receive **monthly credits**. These are credits that you can use to unsubscribe as usual, but each month they are replenished.

For example, the **Inbox Zero Hero** plan ****includes 200 monthly credits. This means you can unsubscribe from 200 emails in each one month period - at the end of your billing period your balance will increase automatically back to 200 credits.

If you run out of credits in a month period then you can purchase a package of [Top-up Credits](credits.md#top-up-credits), these do not expire or count towards your monthly limit.

When you purchase a plan you also receive a one-off bonus of [Top-up Credits](credits.md#top-up-credits) to use. These credits will not replenish.

## Failed Unsubscribes

You are not charged if we don't successfully unsubscribe you. If an unsubscribe fails, then you are refunded the credit that you used. 

## Why is it not free?

So that we can provide a great, privacy-focused service, we charge a small amount for each unsubscribe.

Some of our competitors offer a similar unsubscription service for free. They are able to do this because they make money by aggregating and selling data generated from your emails.

At Leave Me Alone, we have made it our policy to NEVER compromise our users' privacy in this way.

To further ensure this is never a possibility we don't even store any email information. Any emails we scan on your behalf are streamed directly to you and not stored by our system.

This means you can be sure we will never exploit your data in order to keep our lights on ðŸ’¡
