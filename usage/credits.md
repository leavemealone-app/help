# How to use credits to unsubscribe

Each credit you purchase or earn in Leave Me Alone lets you [unsubscribe ](../start-here/how-to-unsubscribe-from-an-email.md)from **one email** in the mail list.

### Pay-as-you-go Credits

If you just need to unsubscribe from emails and don't want to use the features like [Rollups](https://leavemealone.app/rollups) included on our monthly plans then you can purchase **unsubscribe credits**.

These come in packages of 50, 100, 200, and 300, so that you can choose the correct number of unsubscribes for the size of your mailbox.

### Monthly Credits

When you purchase a Leave Me Alone monthly plan you'll receive **unlimited** **unsubscribes**, and get access to more features like [Rollups](https://leavemealone.app/rollups) and Inbox Shield.

## Failed Unsubscribes

You are not charged if we don't successfully unsubscribe you. If an unsubscribe fails, then you are refunded the credit that you used.
