## How can I upgrade my plan?

If you want to enable more Rollups then you can upgrade your plan from the [billing page](https://leavemealone.app/app/profile/billing).

## How can I cancel my plan?

You can cancel your plan at any time from the [billing page](https://leavemealone.app/app/profile/billing). You will still be able to use Leave Me Alone and will receive any Rollups until the end of your billing period.

**After then your subscription will be canceled, which means:**

* All of your Rollups will be disabled.
* You won't receive monthly credits.

Any top-up credits you purchased separately to your plan will remain on your account.
