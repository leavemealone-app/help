## Do you have a free trial?

Yes! You can create and enable your first Rollup and we'll send you the first issue for free!

If you like your digest email and want to keep receiving issues then you'll need to upgrade to one of our paid plans.

## How can I upgrade my plan?

If you want to enable more Rollups then you can upgrade your plan from the [billing page](https://leavemealone.app/app/profile/billing).

## How can I cancel my plan?

You can cancel your plan at any time from the [billing page](https://leavemealone.app/app/profile/billing). You will still be able to use Leave Me Alone and will receive any Rollups until the end of your billing period.

**After then your subscription will be canceled, which means:**

* All of your Rollups will be disabled.
* You won't receive monthly credits.

Any top-up credits you purchased separately to your plan will remain on your account.
