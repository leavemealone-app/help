# How to use Priority Senders

Senders on your Priority Senders will always land in your inbox regardless of any Shield or Rollup rules. **Priority Senders ignore all of your Blocklists, Rollups, and Schedules.**

## How do I use Priority Senders?

You can add any sender by email address or domain from the [Priority Senders](https://leavemealone.app/app/shield/priority) page. This sender will then ignore all of your Blocklists, Rollups, and Schedules.

If you have emails on your **subscription keep list** then you can also mark these emails as Priority Senders by using the Keep List toggle at the bottom of the page.

Senders added from your Keep list will have the blue "Keep List" label. You can remove them individually using the "remove" button, or you can remove them all by disabling the keep list option.
