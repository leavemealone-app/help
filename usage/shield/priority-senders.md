# Priority Senders

Senders on your Priority Senders will always land in your inbox regardless of any Shield or Rollup rules. **Priority Senders ignore all of your Blocklists, Rollups, and Schedules.**

## How do I use Priority Senders?

You can add any sender by email address or domain from the [Priority Senders](https://leavemealone.app/app/shield/priority) page. This sender will then ignore all of your Blocklists, Rollups, and Schedules.
