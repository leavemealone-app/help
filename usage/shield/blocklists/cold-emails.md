# The Cold Emails Blocklist

The Cold Emails blocklist blocks emails sent from mass email tools such as GMass, LemList, SalesForce and many more.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This blocklist is still experimental! Use at your own risk :)
{% endhint %}

These tools allow marketers to send a huge amount of emails designed in a way to look personal, usually to try and get you to buy something. This blocklist is designed to block these emails from ever reaching your inbox.

### How can I spot a cold email?

These emails can be hard to spot as they're supposed to look exactly like an email from a colleague or genuine outreach.

There are a couple of dead-giveaways though such as;

* Faking previous engagement by adding "RE: " to the subject line even though it's the first email in the thread
* Faking previous conversations by referring to a call or discussion elsewhere even though you've never communicated before
* Seeing an unsubscribe link at the bottom of "personal" emails

But of course the best way is to use Leave Me Alone to block them!

### I get some cold emails that aren't blocked!

We're constantly adding support for more major cold-email providers. If you are still getting regular emails that we aren't blocking or have any suggestions for more providers to block please let us know by emailing [support@leavemealone.app](mailto:support@leavemealone.app).
