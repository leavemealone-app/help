# Blocklists

Senders on your Blocklists will be blocked from appearing in your inbox by the [Screener](../screener.md). You can see them in the Screened Mail View, and choose if you wish to allow or continue to block them.

There are two types of Blocklist:

**Your Blocklists**

*   [The Unsubscribe Blocklist](unsubscribe.md)

    As you unsubscribe from emails we add them to this blocklist so they can never email you again.
*   [The Custom Blocklist](custom.md)

    You can add any email or domain you want to this blocklist.

**Built-in Blocklists**

*   [The Social Media Blocklist](social-media.md)

    Automatically blocks emails from popular social media channels, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and other popular social media websites.
*   [The Spam Blocklist](spam.md)

    A dynamic blocklist that checks emails against popular spam databases to determine if the senders are known for sending spam or low quality mail.
*   [The Cold-Emails Blocklist](cold-emails.md)

    Blocks emails from marketers who send a huge amount of emails designed in a way to look personal, usually to try and get you to buy something.
