# Screener

The Screener **gives** **you control** of who is allowed to email you.

When you receive an email from a new sender, the Screener will block it. You can see the emails that have been blocked from the Screener Mail View, where you may choose to keep emails from that sender or continue to block them.

Every day you will receive an email from Leave Me Alone letting you know which senders have been blocked, so you will never miss anything important. From the email you can choose to Allow or Block that sender.

## Can I unblock something I blocked?

You can see the emails that you have blocked from the Screener Mail View, and choose to allow them again.&#x20;

## What about subscription emails?

If we notice that you block an email that could also be unsubscribed from, then we will perform the unsubscribe action too. This means in future you should not receive emails from this sender.

If they continue to email then the Screener will block them, and you should see the `unsubscribed` label next to the email in the Screener Mail View.



## What happens to emails that match Blocklists?

If you receive emails that match a Blocklist then they will be Screened from your inbox and will be sent to you as part of your Daily Screener Digest for you to review, and will appear in your Screener Mail View.

Emails that match senders  on your **Unsubscribed** or **Custom Blocklist** will \*not\* be sent as part of your digest. We consider these emails already reviewed since they were added by you manually at some point. These emails will appear in your Screener Mail View, but with the `blocked` status already applied.



## What do the labels next to screened mail mean?

If mail is screened because of an active Blocklist then it will display that Blocklists label. For example if you add the sender `@example.com` to your Custom Blocklist then the sender will display the `custom` label.
