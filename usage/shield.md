# How to use Inbox Shield

Inbox Shield is a way to reduce the number of emails that are hitting your inbox so that you can lower distractions and be more productive.

## How does Inbox Shield work?

When you **enable Shield** we'll start monitoring your inbox for new emails. If a new email matches a sender on one of your **Shield Blocklists**, then we move it instantly to a hidden folder so that it skips your inbox.

## How do I enable Inbox Shield?

Visit the [Shield Dashboard](https://leavemealone.app/app/shield) and click the "Shields Up" toggle.

## How do I add a sender to a Blocklist?

Currently you can enable Blocklists for emails that you have unsubscribed from, but soon we will launch more Blocklists, as well as the ability to customize them more extensively.

## What is the Unsubscribe Blocklist?

When you unsubscribe from an email in Leave Me Alone the sender will be automatically added to an "Unsubscribe Blocklist". This means that even if the unsubscribe fails, you will no longer receive emails from that sender if you have Shield enabled.

## Can I still see blocked emails in my mailbox?

Yes you can still see the emails in the **\_lma-shield** folder in your email client. These emails will always be in your mail client even if you disable Shields or deactivate your Leave Me Alone account.
