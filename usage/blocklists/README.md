# How to use Blocklists

Senders on your Blocklists will be blocked from appearing in your inbox. You can still find the emails in your mail client but they won't distract you any more!

## How do I add a sender to a Blocklist?

When you unsubscribe from an email it'll be automatically added to your Unsubscribe Blocklist. To block any other sender by email address or domain you can add it to your Custom Blocklist.

Don't forget, you can use our built-in blocklists to block the most common social media and spam emails!
