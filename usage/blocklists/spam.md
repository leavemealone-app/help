# What is the Spam Blocklist?

The Spam Blocklist does exactly what you'd expect. It blocks spam from your Inbox!

The blocklist combines multiple sources to cover a range of different types of spam email, including;

* phishing, fraud, and “419” emails.
* emails containing or linking to malware or viruses.
* emails sent from domains with poor reputation.

Primarily this list uses the Spamhaus dbl, an international nonprofit organization that tracks spam and related cyber threats.
