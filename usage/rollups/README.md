# Rollups

Do you receive newsletters that you love to receive but that are always lost in the noise of your inbox or you never have time to read your favorite emails when they arrive because you're busy or distracted?

Then Rollups is for you!

## What is a Rollup?

Rollups are personalized collections of your favorite newsletters, sent as a single email.

When youâ€™re done unsubscribing, click the Rollup icon to combine the emails you love to read into a beautiful weekly digest.
