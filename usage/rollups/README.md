# Rollups

Do you receive newsletters that you love to receive but that are always lost in the noise of your inbox or you never have time to read your favorite emails when they arrive because you're busy or distracted?

Then Rollups is for you!

## What is a Rollup?

Rollups are personalized collections of your favorite newsletters, sent as a single email.

When youâ€™re done unsubscribing, click the Rollup icon to combine the emails you love to read into a beautiful weekly digest.

## How does Rollups work?

Rollups is super simple!

When you create a Rollup we automatically create the first issue and are ready to start watching.

When you add a senders email address we'll watch your mailboxes for emails that come from that sender and move them out of your inbox so they don't distract you.

When it's your chosen day and time we'll send you an email with all the mail you received in your Rollup in the past week!
