## Why can't I add an email in Google Workspace/G Suite to my Rollup?

While we can scan your account for subscription emails we are unable to watch your Google Workspace/G Suite account for emails arriving in your inbox. This means that if you added a subscription from a G Suite account to your Rollup it wouldn't work, which is why we disable the button.

If you would like to Rollup emails from your Google Workspace/G Suite email accounts then you still can do this by connecting your account using IMAP.

If you sign in with Google you need to switch to signing in with password first. You can do this from your profile security page [here](https://leavemealone.app/app/profile/security).
{% endhint %}

To connect your account you can follow [this guide](https://help.leavemealone.app/guides/connecting-gmail) for connecting a Gmail account. The steps are the same, just sign into Gmail with your Google Workspace/G Suite account instead.
