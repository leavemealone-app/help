## What is a Rollup?

Rollups are personalized collections of your favorite newsletters, sent as a single email.

When youâ€™re done unsubscribing, click the Rollup icon to combine the emails you love to read into a beautiful weekly digest.

## How often can I receive my Rollup?

You'll receive your Rollup digest email once per week, but you chose the day and time.

We plan to add more flexible scheduling in the future, please let us know if you'd be interested in this.
