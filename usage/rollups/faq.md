# FAQ

## How often can I receive my Rollup?

You'll receive your Rollup digest email once per week, and you chose the day and time.

We plan to add more flexible scheduling in the future, please let us know if you'd be interested in this.

## What is an issue?

Your Rollup is like a magazine or newspaper. Each time we send your Rollup we're sending you the next issue in your regular series of weekly digest emails.

When you create your Rollup we automatically create the first issue for you \(Issue \#1\). When you receive an issue the next one will be automatically created \(Issue \#2, Issue \#3 etc\). This provides a way for you to see and read the previous Rollups you have received easily!

## How can I see which emails are being Rolled up?
