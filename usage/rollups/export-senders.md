# Exporting sender data

Sometimes you need more customisable filters than Rollups allows, or simply to export your Rollup senders so that you can use them for another purpose.&#x20;

From your Rollup page you will find an Export button. This exports your senders directly to a Gmail filters XML file, which can be imported into your Gmail.
