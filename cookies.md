# Cookies

**Marketing Website**

We've been through pains to remove [all the cookies possible from our homepage](https://blog.leavemealone.app/no-more-cookies/). However, if you are referred by an existing user \(or by one of our amazing affiliates\), then you will see a cookie banner. 

Affiliates and users get benefits for referring new users, and we use this cookie to track your signup so we know who to give these bonuses to.

**App**

After you have logged in we use cookies for various things including your login session, and for payment. We also use other browser storage that often is included within the term "cookie". We store some preference information in LocalStorage, and store your mail list information in IndexedDB. This data is cleared when you log out of the app.
